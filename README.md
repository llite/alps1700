# alps1700

A custom handwired keyboard with a similar layout to 1800 sans the function row and more compact.

Specs:
- Bluetooth LE
- USB C
- Alps SKCM Cream Damped switches
- 2000mAh battery
- [Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2829) 

Case is 3d printed out of Formfutura's [Galaxy titanium](https://www.partsbuilt.com/galaxy-pla-titanium-silver-formfutura/). Because of printer bed size limitations it had to be printed in two parts. 

Keycaps and switches are from an [Apple Extended Keyboard II](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard_II), with 3d-printed caps for space, right-shift and num-pad 0.


Firmware is based on [Mike Roberts'](https://github.com/ecopoesis) [NEK type A](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/nek_type_a), with a few adjustment to account for the different layout.
