All the models needed to make the keyboard.

The case is to large to print in one piece on most 3d-printers so there are split models included. 

Depending on the keycap set you may need to print some keys. There are files for a 6u spacebar, 1.75u right shift, and 1u numpad 0. These are modeled off the AEK2's keycaps which have a different profile than most caps. There are libaries for printing caps like [rsheldiii's KeyV2](https://github.com/rsheldiii/keyV2) in case you need them.
